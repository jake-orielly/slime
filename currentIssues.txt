pistons chains can thwart collision detection
pistons attached head first donâ€™t extend (unless they have a block between them)
When multiple blocks are stuck when moving in dir when block A is in dir from block B block B will disappear (see slime2x level), but will reappear upon moving in any other dir
Coordinate system mixed up (exit tiles vs blocks)
